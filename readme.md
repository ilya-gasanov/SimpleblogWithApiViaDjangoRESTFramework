    This simple blog site was built on Harrison Kinsley video tutorial 
    (you can watch it here https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex/videos)

    I have added base API functions via Django Rest Framework,
    they can be used at - site/api/blog  (list of posts)
                        - site/api/blog/post_id (post create,edit, 
                                                    detail view, delete)
    It runs as standard on the Django`s test server
